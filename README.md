# WSL Auto Sync

Automatically synchronize user settings from Windows to your WSL distro.

## Motivation
I use an hybrid setup with certain tools running on Windows and others on WSL. I wanted to be able to use the same settings on both environments without having to manually synchronize them.

## Installation

From a powershell prompt, run the following command:
```
.\install.ps1
```
